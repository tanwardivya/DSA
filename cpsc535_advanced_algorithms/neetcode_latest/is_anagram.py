# Is Anagram
# Solved 
# Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

# An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

# Output: true
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

# Output: false
# Constraints:

# s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s)!= len(t):
            return False

        countS, countT = {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            countS[s[i]] = 1 + countS.get(s[i], 0)
            countT[t[i]] = 1 + countT.get(t[i], 0)

        for character in countS:
            if countS[character] != countT.get(character,0):
                return False

        return True
